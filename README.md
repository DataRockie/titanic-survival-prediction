# titanic-survival-prediction
##What I have done
In this project, I have created a decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger’s features, such as sex and age. I start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until I am able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.

##What I have learnt
This project introduced me some of the concepts of machine learning.
